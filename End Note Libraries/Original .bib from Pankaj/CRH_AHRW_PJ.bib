  abstract = {Background: The current study was designed to investigate the epidemiology
	and long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes following simple
	dislocation of the elbow in adults.. Methods: We identified all adult
	patients treated at our trauma center for a simple dislocation of
	the elbow during a ten-year period. One hundred and forty patients
	were eligible for review, and 110(79%) were reviewed at a mean of
	eighty-eight months (range, sixteen to 171 months) after the injury.
	This review included clinical examination, the Disabilities of the
	Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Oxford elbow questionnaire,
	and a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Patients reported
	long-term residual deficits in the range of elbow motion. The mean
	DASH score was 6.7 points (95% confidence interval, 4 to 9 points).
	The mean Oxford elbow score was 90.3 points (95% confidence interval,
	87.8 to 92.9 points). The mean satisfaction score was 85.6 points
	(95% confidence interval, 82.2 to 89 points). Sixty-two patients
	(56%) reported residual subjective stiffness of the elbow. Nine patients
	(8%) reported subjective instability, and sixty-eight (62%) reported
	residual pain. The satisfaction and DASH scores showed good correlation
	with absolute range of motion in the injured elbow, as did the overall
	Oxford elbow score and the pain and function components of that score.
	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that loss of elbow flexion (p
	= 0.001) and female sex (p = 0.002) were both independent predictors
	of a poorer DASH score. Reduced elbow flexion also predicted a poorer
	score on the function component of the Oxford elbow score (p = 0.02).
	A reduced flexion-extension arc of motion predicted a poorer overall
	Oxford elbow score (p = 0.02), a poorer score on the pain component
	of the Oxford elbow score (p = 0.02), and poorer overall satisfaction
	(p = 0.005). Female sex. predicted a poorer score on the psychosocial
	component of the Oxford elbow score (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Although
	patients generally report a favorable long-term functional outcome
	after simple dislocation of the elbow, these injuries are not entirely
	benign. The rate of residual pain and elbow stiffness is high. Functional
	instability is less' comnnon and does not often limit activities.},

	the influence of socioeconomic deprivation on fracture outcome has
	not been documented before. The aim of this study was to determine
	if socioeconomic deprivation influenced the short-term outcome following
	a fracture of the radial head or neck. Methods: We identified from
	a prospective database all patients who sustained a radial head or
	neck fracture over an 18-month period. The primary outcome measure
	for this study was the patient-reported short musculoskeletal function
	assessment (SMFA). The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was used
	to quantify deprivation, and any correlation with functional outcome
	was determined. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine
	the influence of deprivation on outcome once other significant demographic
	and fracture characteristics had been accounted for. Results: There
	were 200 patients in the study cohort, of which 107 (53.5%) were
	female and the mean age was 44 years (16-83). At a mean follow-up
	of 6 months the median SMFA score was 0.54 (0-55.4). The SMFA was
	found to be influenced by the IMD, with increasing deprivation associated
	with a poorer outcome (p = 0.006). On multivariate analysis, the
	AO fracture classification, compensation and increasing deprivation
	were the only independent predictors of outcome (all p < 0.05). Conclusions:
	We have a shown a clear correlation between functional outcome and
	socioeconomic status, with the most deprived patients reporting a
	poorer outcome. Future work should be aimed at determining which
	aspects of deprivation influence patient outcome, with modifiable
	factors targeted in future health-care planning. (c) 2012 Elsevier

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current available literature related to scaphoid fracture
	epidemiology is inconsistent. The aim of this study was to describe
	the epidemiology of true scaphoid fractures in a defined adult population.
	METHODS: Using a prospective database, we identified all patients
	who sustained a radiographically confirmed acute fracture of the
	scaphoid over a 1-year period. Age, gender, mechanism of injury,
	the Herbert fracture classification, and associated injuries were
	recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 151 scaphoid fractures
	diagnosed giving an annual incidence of 29 per 100,000 (95% confidence
	interval, 25-34). The median age of males was significantly younger
	when compared with females (p = 0.002), with a male (n = 105) predominance
	seen (p < 0.001). Low-energy falls from a standing height were most
	common (40.4%), but with males being significantly more likely to
	sustain their fracture after a high-energy injury (p < 0.001). The
	most common fracture was Herbert classification B2 (n = 55, 36.4%),
	with unstable fractures more common in younger patients (p = 0.025)
	following a high-energy injury (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: We have
	reported the epidemiology of true scaphoid fractures, with young
	males at risk of sustaining a fracture. Knowledge of the true incidence
	of scaphoid fractures and an understanding of the demographic risk
	factors are essential when assessing the suspected scaphoid fracture,
	particularly when considering further imaging modalities. (J Trauma.

  abstract = {Introduction: The advent of modern arthroscopic techniques has lead
	to widespread surgical repair of multiligament injuries of the knee.
	Although functional outcomes may be linked to the recovery of strength
	and range of movement, studies have failed to report objective measures
	of strength recovery. The primary aim of this study was to describe
	the recovery of isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings' strength. The
	secondary aims were to describe the recovery of movement and function.
	Methods: Isokinetic muscle dynamomentry was performed by a research
	physiotherapist. Range-of-movement and patient-reported outcome measures
	(International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Short Musculoskeletal
	Function Questionnaire (SMFA) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis
	Outcome Score (KOOS)) were also evaluated. Results: At 2 years, quadriceps
	peak torque had recovered to 85% of the uninjured side and hamstrings
	were 90%. Hamstring recovery was faster than quadriceps, but at final
	recovery there were no overall differences between muscle group recovery
	(p = 0.194). Patients obtained a mean 135 degrees of flexion. The
	KOOSs showed that sporting and quality of life factors recovered
	more slowly. Although 95% of patients returned to work, 20% had to
	change types of employment. Median time to return to work was 8 weeks.
	Nearly one-third (30%) of patients returned to their original level
	of sport at 2 years. Conclusion: Muscle strength improves after multiple
	ligament reconstruction. There is no difference in outcomes for different
	muscle groups at 2 years. Deficits persist in comparison with the
	uninjured limb. A proportion of patients will be unable to return
	to the pre-injury occupation or sporting ability. (C) 2011 Elsevier

	of biomarker elevation in patients undergoing hip replacement and
	to investigate any correlation with functional scores and complications.
	METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that examined the profile
	of biomarkers of alcohol misuse in 1049 patients undergoing hip replacement.
	Results. Gamma-glutamyltransferase was elevated in 150 (17.6%), and
	mean corpuscular volume was elevated in 23 (4%). At one year general
	physical health was poorer where there was elevation of gammaGT,
	and the mental health and hip function was poorer with elevation
	of MCV. There were no differences in complications. DISCUSSION: Raised
	biomarkers can alert clinicians to potential problems. They also
	provide an opportunity to perform further investigation and offer
	intervention. Future research should focus on the use in orthopaedic
	practice of validated screening questionnaires and more sensitive
	biomarkers of alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates
	a potential substantial proportion of unrecognised alcohol misuse
	that is associated with poorer functional scores in patients after
	total hip replacement.},

	Patients and methods: 200 consecutive patients attending a trauma

	through diagnosis to discharge. Results: The prevalence of true fracture
	was 16% and was associated with mate sex and injury playing sport.
	Magnetic resonance imaging has the best diagnostic performance, with

  abstract = {Background: Anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint in younger
	patients is associated with a high risk of recurrence and persistent
	functional deficits. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy
	of a primary arthroscopic Bankart repair, while controlling for the
	therapeutic effects produced by the arthroscopic intervention and
	joint lavage. Methods: In a single-center, double-blind clinical
	trial, eighty-eight adult patients under thirty-five years of age
	who had sustained a primary anterior glenohumeral dislocation were
	randomized to receive either an arthroscopic examination and joint
	lavage alone or together with an anatomic repair of the Bankart lesion.
	Assessment of the rate of recurrent instability, functional outcome
	with use of three scores), range of movement, patient satisfaction,
	direct health-service costs, and treatment complications was completed
	for eighty-four of these patients (forty-two in each group) during
	the subsequent two years. Results: In the two years after the primary
	dislocation, the risk of a further dislocation was reduced by 76%
	and the risk of all recurrent instability was reduced by 82% in the
	Bankart repair group compared with the group that had arthroscopy
	and lavage alone. The functional scores were also better (p < 0.05),
	the treatment costs were lower (p = 0.012), and patient satisfaction
	was higher (p < 0.001) after arthroscopic repair. The improved functional
	outcome appeared to be mediated through the prevention of instability
	since the functional outcome in patients with stable shoulders was
	similar, irrespective of the initial treatment allocation. The patients
	who had a Bankart repair and played contact sports were also more
	likely to have returned to their sport at two years (relative risk
	= 3.4, p = 0.007). Conclusions: Following a first-time anterior dislocation
	of the shoulder, there is a marked treatment benefit from primary
	arthroscopic repair of a Bankart lesion, which is distinct from the
	so-called background therapeutic effect of the arthroscopic examination
	and lavage of the joint. However, primary repair does not appear
	to confer a functional benefit to patients with a stable shoulder
	at two years after the dislocation. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic
	Level I. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of
	levels of evidence.},
